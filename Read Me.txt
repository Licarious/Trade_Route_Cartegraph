Place your 00_tradenodes.txt, default.map, definitons.csv, highmap.bmp, and provinces.bmp into Input, then fidget with config.cfg to get the settings you want, finaly execute RunMe.pyc.

The program will go through each trade node generate a color mat covering the land provinces in them. (This generation is what takes the most time.)
Said mats are then stitch those together into accessible trade area.  
This is done form starting node(s) and radiate out until they reach the end node(s).

if province changes are made to a node then that node will be redrawn.

The program does not regenerate _Trade_Network and _Trade_Node maps from the Collectible Network/Individual Node folders.  
If you want to do that then you will need to remove the _Trade_Network maps you want redone from the Collectible Network folder.
